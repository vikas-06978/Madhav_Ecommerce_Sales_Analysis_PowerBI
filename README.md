# Madhav_Ecommerce_Sales_Analysis_PowerBI

Welcome to the Madhav E-commerce Sales Dashboard. This project helps you turn raw sales data into clear, interactive visuals that make your business trends easy to understand.
Inside the dashboard, you’ll find key metrics like total sales, profits, and quantities sold right up front. You can explore sales by product category, payment method, states, cities, and even see which customers drive the most revenue.

The dashboard lets you check profits month by month and view how different products and sub-categories are performing. You can filter and search through the order data, which includes information such as order amount, quantity, profit, category, payment mode, customer name, location, and order date.

Everything is laid out visually so you can quickly spot top products, profitable regions, and payment trends. The clean charts and summary panels make it easy for anyone, from managers to analysts, to get useful insights from the data.

If you want to analyze retail sales or simply understand your order data better, this dashboard provides everything needed for smart decision-making. All you need is your sales data in the right format, and you’re good to go.
